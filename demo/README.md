# Demo with Angular 2 QuickStart

This is demonstration app for `ng2-directory-tree` based on Angular2 QuickStart: https://github.com/angular/quickstart

### Usage

- Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

- Start the server process

```
npm start
```

- Access to http://localhost:3000


### For developers

For starting to develop `ng2-directory-tree`, `npm link` might give us some convenience.

At `ng2-directory-tree` directory (top level of this git repository):

```
npm link
```

Then move to `ng2-directory-tree/demo` directory and execute:

```
npm link ng2-directory-tree
```

Finally, this demo app tracks our changes on `ng2-directory-tree/src/*` files.
